<h3 align="center">University of the People</h3>
<p>This course covers the basics of computer programming and provides a foundation for further
learning in this area. No previous computer programming knowledge is required to finish this course.
The course uses the Python programming language which is very simple and straightforward. The
course also covers abstract concepts which can be applied to almost any programming language,
and students are encouraged to pay attention to these, since the way of thinking like a programmer
is the most valuable lesson they will learn.</p>
